# HTML5 Anchors

If you need to embed an anchor into your URL for sharing a specific portion of a page, you can do it with anchors. It does what it says on the tin!

Just use `www.example.com/page#section` and give an element an id of section `<div id="section" />`. Then reference the script for scrolling to the section on load.
